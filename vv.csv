""when i heard anita's story, i spent some time with the villagers, researching the facts of this story. since i have already filmedother stories on similar issues, i knew that corruption was probably the key player in this story too. sure enough, i found that despite the villagers having submitted an application, bhushanbanra, the panchayat member in question hadn't bothered to respond. i filmed anita's testimony, and then i took about 8-10 villagers with me to my studio. i had also requested veronica bodra, the sarpanch, and bhushanbanra to join us. once in my studio, i loaded the video on my computer & screened it for everybody. then we all sat down & had an honest discussion about this. since i knew that corruption was the core problem here, i categorically stated that if issuing joseph's death certificate was being held back due to any individual attempting to siphon off money meant for anita, it was illegal, and mathagoda village would stand by me to ensure that these individuals would pay the price.""  bhushanbodra immediately issued the death certificate, and anita began receiving her pension from february 2013. ""i know this will seem a paltry payoff to most people. a single person in a small village benefitted from this video. but for anita, her world changed. it was a huge victory that we, as a community, had won together. her family was already fragmented because of poverty. her son was unable to complete his education & is now in odisha somewhere, slogging as a driver. her daughter enrolled in college with much difficulty, only because someone loaned anita the enrollment fees. and her story isn't something unique. many of my people suffer like this - they don't know anything about schemes available from the government to support them - even if they do, they don't know whom to approach, how to approach. the village headman, champamunda, in this case, was powerless to intervene on behalf of his people, because of threats from cheaters (sic). however, when he saw how much faith his people had in me, he too came on camera to record his testimony."" anita is yet to receive her arrears. xavier has no intention of giving up. he whips out his little 'data book' where he jots copious notes about every video he's made. with nine videos to his name, he now knows the importance of preparation, research and documentation. he speaks of the lengthy process of identifying the relevant department to approach to facilitate change, and ways of approaching administration. ""earlier, i'd hear a story & start filming immediately. now i prepare a list of b-rolls i want to capture, questions i'd like to ask. when i go up to question anybody, i can't just blast (sic) them with accusations. i need to have facts & data to validate what i'm saying. also, because there are so many people just waiting for me to mess up, i have to be extra certain with every cause i take up.""  the cynicism creeps through when he talks of how he is currently under threat from certain citizens who are sitting back and reaping the benefits of other's broken dreams. however, despite the occasional disillusionment, xavier is determined to carry forth his father's legacy of being central to his tribal community's struggle for rights & recognition. ""my people are disempowered because of poverty. their struggles for survival shrouds all other scarcity. i will change that with every story i film & follow up. it's crucial to be able to work together - if we sort out a system where we can sit down with administration and freely discuss our problems and come up with a solution, change is definitely possible. and of course, a camera helps!""  read also: directive principles of state policy, national social assistance programme (nsap)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"no",NA,NA,NA,NA,"yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"jh_152_impact",NA,NA,TRUE,"governance and accountability","anti poverty programs",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2012-04-01,NA,NA,NA,"jh_152",NA,2016-12-19 05:58:04,NA,NA,2012-07-27,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=errvj0ux4wg"
